    \item I apologize for how silly that was; you're not likely to ever have
          that many people trying to push at the same time
    \item If you haven't finished, don't worry about it
    \item It is important to recognize that Git does not do ANY merge
          resolutions on the remote
    \item While this is much safer than the alternative, it does present a
          bottleneck if too many people must push to the same remote
    \item Large, open source projects with many contributors tend to use more
          pull oriented workflows
    \item \texttt{git format-patch}, \texttt{git send-email}, GitHub pull
          requests, and so on
